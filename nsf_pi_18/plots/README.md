1. external comparisons for static languages

2. external comparisons for dynamic languages

3. partial typing internal experiments

    a) type-based vs. coercions (space efficient)
	b) unspecialized vs. specialized for proxied coercions
	c) monotonic vs. proxied for coercions
	e) eager vs. lazy for monotonic coercions
